HOW TO USE 

	Double-click on the main.html file and load in your browser. 

USE OF BOOTSTRAP

	I used Bootstrap to create a nice looking navigation bar that is fixed. I also used the "jumbotron" class in Bootstrap to create the background shape behind the text/content of each "page". Finally, I used Bootstrap to create the responsive columns in the projects page. 

WHAT I LEARNED

	I am new to web dev, and learned how to work with Bootstrap, use custom hex colors, use the !important flag, use padding to move content to below the nav bar, use a favicon, have multiple pages, round image borders, style transparency, use custom fonts, and edit colors. 

CONTENTS

	There are 4 content pages of the site: 

		1. Home, which details some information about me and has a photo of me. 

		2. Projects, which lists 3 projects I have worked on, each with an image and description, in 3 responsive Bootstrap columns. 

		3. Contact, which has an email to link, a link to LinkedIn, and an Instagram badge. 

		4. Resume, which has a download for a pdf of my resume. 

	There is an additional cover page that appears when my name on the navbar is clicked, as I wanted to have a "splash page", which I'd like to make further improvements to as I continue this course. 

CSS FILES
	The styles.css file has the main styling for all of the pages, while the other css files correspond to the html file that shares their name.
